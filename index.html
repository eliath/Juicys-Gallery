		<p class="col-text">Juicys Gallery is a pop-up exhibition platform  based in New York City. In response to the astronomical real estate prices of New York, Juicys Gallery utilizes the affordability and ubiquity of the self-storage units to create temporary gallery situations in high visibility neighborhoods. By transforming the self storage space into an art gallery, JuicysÂ offers young and emerging artists an opportunity to showcase their work  in an alternative yet accessible environment. Juicys Gallery will be programming one month solo exhibitions starting in February 2014.</p>
		<p>Juicys also hosts a website gallery space where artists working on computer and web-based projects are able to visualize an exhibition. Juicys Online exhibitions will begin in March 2014.</p>
