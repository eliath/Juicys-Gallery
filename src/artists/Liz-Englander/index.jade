            p    
                | I wanted a hundred times to kill myself, but I still loved life. 
                | This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our most macabre 
                | tendencies: for is there anything more silly than to continually 
                | want to carry a burden that one can always throw to the ground?
            p.italic.noindent
                | Voltaire, Candide 
            p
                | Of course it might have been some other city, had circumstances 
                | been different and the time been different and had I been 
                | different, might have been Paris or Chicago or even San 
                | Francisco, but because I am talking about myself I am talking 
                | here about New York.
            p.italic.noindent
                | Joan Didion, "Goodbye to All That"
            p
                | For my first show in New York, I present a farewell to the city, 
                | my adopted home. Three years here with a rain cloud lurking over 
                | my head and I am just beginning to discern its outlines; it 
                | looks suspiciously like a forlorn, tearÂ­soaked Papaya Dog. 
                | Sometimes a change of scenery is the only way to quiet a fussy 
                | baby. I'll be gone when the coconut oil solidifies.
            p.noindent
                | Love forever,
