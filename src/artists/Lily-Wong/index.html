Juicys Gallery is pleased to announce it's inaugural show, 
a solo exhibition by Brooklyn based artist Lily Wong on view 
at Manhattan Mini Storage, 28 Second Avenue in New York. 
Please join us for an opening reception on April 2nd, 2014 
7足-9pm. RSVP required.</p><p>For 'A Taste of Spring is a Welcome Thing', Wong presents 
three recent drawings from her lithographic process. 
Completed in a simple brush and ink style, each drawing shows 
a solitary subject in midst of a banal domestic task. 
Intended as studies for lithographic prints, Wong draws her 
imagery from screen captures of movies she watches on her 
personal computer. Obvious American cult classics make up the 
repertoire: Dazed and Confused, Home Alone, and American 
Graffiti all count as favorites. But the scenes chosen from 
these films have an uncanny dynamic余 each composition seems to 
capture a moment caught in between, paused, yet in pursuit, 
offering a unique quality of gentle yearning.</p><p>Born in Seattle, Washington to Chinese and Korean parents, 
Wong draws on her competing cultural influences with a sly 
subtlety. In the aesthetics of Chinese literati painting, a 
beautiful ink mark is not one that faithfully reproduces the 
appearance of its subject, but instead successfully captures the 
spirit of its essence. Focusing her gaze on the pop culture 
landscape of the West, and more specifically, teen films of the 
80's and 90's, Wong adopts this philosophy in her own brush and 
ink drawings. The seemingly vapid characters of Clueless and Breaking 
Away are imbued with a romantic sincerity that equally cherishes their 
naive sense of hope and the trivial urgency that this hope is bound to. 
Siphoning from her own experience as a cloistered teen, Wong finds 
solace in the picture of a dreamer in solitude. Quietly, her drawings 
reveal to us the lonelier pursuits of the contempo足casual condition. In 
this world, watering a plant is more of an attempt at companionship than 
interior decoration足 proving a friend in need is a friend indeed.</p></div><footer><img src="/artists/Lily-Wong/taste1.jpg"><img src="/artists/Lily-Wong/taste2.jpg"><img src="/artists/Lily-Wong/taste3.jpg"><img src="/artists/Lily-Wong/taste4.jpg"><img src="/artists/Lily-Wong/taste5.jpg"><img src="/artists/Lily-Wong/taste6.jpg"></footer><script>_main.init();</script></body></html>
