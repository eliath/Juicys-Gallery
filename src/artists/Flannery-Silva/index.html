Juicys Gallery is pleased to announce ‘Keeper of Shrinking 
Violet” a solo exhibition by Baltimore based artist Flannery 
Silva, on view at Manhattan Mini Storage 510 W. 21st Street in 
New York.</p><p>For ‘Keeper of Shrinking Violet” Silva presents a suite of small 
floor sculptures, a mobile, a poster, and a children’s book in 
PDF form. Scattered over a variety of media, she enamors with an 
astute sense of loss. Though gloomy and contemplative, this is 
not “loss” in the traditional sense, of loved ones or loved 
things. Instead the pieces clue witnesses to that rather 
difficult evolution of the self. As personality adapts to 
maturity and begins a steady molting of old layers, subtle 
changes manifest themselves through quiet castaways. What was 
once seemingly true or important fades to not.</p><p>Likened to the caterpillar before its final cocooning, Silva’s 
new work can be viewed as her latest apolysis. Throughout its 
development each butterfly larvae goes through a series of 
instars- a process of shedding their exoskeleton cuticle for a 
new, harder and bigger shell. As one cuticle reaches the end of 
its cycle another replaces it from underneath, stronger and more 
prepared for the outside world than the last. By the 
caterpillar’s last instar, the future butterfly’s wing patterns 
begin to emerge, keying the world to its beauty. In this 
adaptation, we peek at the fragile markings of a visual 
danseuse. Elegantly crafted and lightly peppered with literary 
references, Silva’s sculpture garden breathes full with life. 
Caution though, this keeper seems to be battling inwardly: 
bonnets whispering, flowers wilting, ghosts waving back. These 
are the dreams of a country girl caught mid-journey. And it is 
clear this shell is just as strong as the last, if not stronger. 
For as one wanes, another waxes.</p></div><footer><a href="/artists/Flannery-Silva/Keeper_of_Shrinking_Violet.pdf">Keeper_of_Shrinking_Violet.pdf</a><br><a href="http://romantica1fem.info/keeper_of_shrinking_violet.html">http://romantica1fem.info/keeper_of_shrinking_violet.html</a></footer><script>_main.init();</script></body></html>
