Juicys Gallery is pleased to present a solo exhibition of new 
paintings by Keith AllYn Spencer, on view at Manhattan Mini 
Storage, 220 South Street in New York. Please join us for an 
opening reception on Thursday, May 8, from 6-8pm. RSVP required.</p><p>KEITH ALLyN SPENCER was born and raised in the American desert 
southwest border region. An emphasis w/ the middle letter of his 
name helps diminish the perpetual mix-up with similar named 
persons: Keith Spencer, Kevin Spencer, Kenneth Allan Spencer, 
Spencer Kenny Allen, Kanye West, so on and so forth.</p><p>Currently, Kurt resides with his family in Bloomington, Indiana, 
USA – the tie-dye capital of the world. He is a (just) Visiting 
Assistant Professor at Indiana University, trying to navigate 
towards long-term job security, cul-de-sacs, and organic 
groceries. Kent has showcased his works in various group shows, 
“p0p-up” spaces, coffee shops, bars, blogs and academic 
galleries. Most recently, Karl has held solo exhibitions at 
Welcome Screen, Oliver Francis, Target, Domino’s Pizza and the 
Rhode Island Credit Union so help you God.</p><p>Juicys Gallery is a pop-up exhibition platform based in New York 
City. Founded in 2014, Juicys Gallery capitalizes on the 
affordability and ubiquity of the self-storage industry to 
create temporary gallery situations.</p><p class="RSVP">RSVP to <span class="contact"></span></p></div><footer><img src="/artists/Keith-AllYn-Spencer/1_enswbl.png"><img src="/artists/Keith-AllYn-Spencer/2_enswbl.png"><img src="/artists/Keith-AllYn-Spencer/3_enswbl.png"><img src="/artists/Keith-AllYn-Spencer/4_Ankle-Breaker.png"><img src="/artists/Keith-AllYn-Spencer/5_Snowoman.png"><img src="/artists/Keith-AllYn-Spencer/6_enswbl.png"><img src="/artists/Keith-AllYn-Spencer/7_Trouble.png"><img src="/artists/Keith-AllYn-Spencer/8_Bobby-Sized.png"></footer><script>_main.init();</script></body></html>
